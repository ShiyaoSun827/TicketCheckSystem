## üì± Mobile Access to Localhost via Cloudflare Tunnel

To access your development environment on mobile (localhost:3000), use Cloudflare Tunnel.

**Steps:**

1. Install Cloudflared:

   `npm install -g cloudflared`

2. Start your local development server:

   `npm run dev`

3. Open a new terminal and run:

   `cloudflared tunnel --url [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)`

4. Cloudflare will generate a public URL

   `Copy the link and open it in your phone browser`

   Alternatively, generate a QR code from this URL for scanning


**Notes:**

- The tunnel URL is temporary and changes every time
- For best performance, ensure both PC and phone are on the same Wi-Fi
- Not recommended for production deployment
